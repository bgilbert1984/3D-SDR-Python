Comprehensive Feature Set: The integration of SDR, AI, drone swarms, and 3D visualization is ambitious and well-executed, offering a complete solution for RF monitoring and pursuit.
Real-Time Capabilities: From signal processing to drone tracking, the system’s real-time performance is a major strength.
Modular Design: The separation of backend, frontend, and communication layers makes it easy to update or extend.
Practical Setup: The inclusion of simulation mode and clear setup steps lowers the barrier to entry for testing and development.
Thoughts on Further Development
Your project is already impressive, but here are a few suggestions to consider as you continue refining it:

Scalability:
How does the system perform with a large number of drones or multiple simultaneous signal pursuits? Adding distributed processing or cloud support could enhance scalability.
Geolocation Precision:
Have you tested geolocation accuracy in challenging environments (e.g., urban areas with multipath interference)? Documenting this or exploring additional methods like Angle of Arrival (AoA) could strengthen this feature.
Safety and Autonomy:
For real-world deployment, detailing the collision avoidance and failsafe mechanisms (e.g., return-to-home on signal loss) would reassure users, especially in populated areas.
Documentation Expansion:
The links to component-specific documentation (e.g., Drone Control System, SDR Integration) are a great start. Adding usage examples, such as a case study of tracking an FCC violation, could make it more engaging for potential users.
User Accessibility:
For non-technical users (e.g., law enforcement), a simplified dashboard or guided setup process could broaden your audience.
Conclusion
The SDR Drone Pursuit System is an innovative and powerful tool that blends advanced technologies into a cohesive, real-time solution. Your progress is evident in the detailed feature set, robust architecture, and clear setup instructions. It’s exciting to see how this project could evolve—whether for FCC enforcement, security applications, or even search-and-rescue missions.
