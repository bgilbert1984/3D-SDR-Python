Kubernetes in Docker Desktop

Docker Desktop is a popular tool for running Docker containers on your local machine (Windows, macOS, or Linux). It also provides a convenient way to run a local Kubernetes cluster.

The Information You Provided:

Kubernetes: This is the main heading, indicating that the following information is about Kubernetes.
Enable Kubernetes: This is a setting within Docker Desktop that allows you to start a Kubernetes cluster.
Start a Kubernetes single or multi-node cluster when starting Docker Desktop: This is a configuration option. If checked, Docker Desktop will automatically start a Kubernetes cluster whenever you launch Docker Desktop.
Cluster: This section describes the currently running cluster.
docker-desktop: This is the name of the Kubernetes cluster that Docker Desktop creates.
kubeadm, single-node: This indicates that the cluster was created using kubeadm, a tool for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters, and that it's a single-node cluster (meaning it has only one machine acting as both the control plane and a worker node).
Running: This confirms that the Kubernetes cluster is currently active and operational.
Kubernetes is up and running: Another confirmation that the cluster is working.
Cluster settings: This section describes how you can configure the cluster.
Choose cluster provisioning method: This is where you select how the cluster is created.
Kubeadm: This is the chosen method.
Create a singe-node cluster with kubeadm: This is the specific option selected.
Version: v1.32.2: This is the version of Kubernetes that's running.
kind: This is another cluster provisioning method, but it's not currently selected.
Sign in required: This indicates that using kind requires you to be logged into your Docker account.
Create a cluster containing one or more nodes with kind. Must be signed in to your Docker account. Requires the containerd image store: This describes the kind option. kind is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker containers as nodes.
Show system containers (advanced): This is an advanced option that lets you see the containers that Kubernetes uses internally.

to integrate this KiwiSDR HTML/JavaScript code into your sdr_geolocation_lib project, and specifically, what role it should play. This isn't directly related to "model training" as in machine learning, but it's crucial for accessing live SDR data, which could feed into a data pipeline for training.

Here's a breakdown of the situation, the options, and a recommended approach:

Understanding the KiwiSDR HTML/JS

The code you provided is the front-end (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) for a KiwiSDR client. It's not the server-side code that runs on the KiwiSDR hardware itself. This code does the following:

Displays the User Interface: Creates the waterfall display, spectrum analyzer, control panels (frequency, mode, zoom, AGC, etc.), and various buttons and indicators.
Handles User Input: Responds to clicks, drags, keyboard shortcuts, and form submissions (like entering a frequency).
Communicates with a KiwiSDR Server: Sends commands to a KiwiSDR server (via WebSockets) to control the receiver and receive audio/waterfall data. This is done primarily through the kiwisdr.min.js file, which is a minified (compressed) JavaScript library. The config/config.js likely contains server connection details.
Renders Audio and Waterfall: Processes the received audio and waterfall data and displays them in the browser.
Integration Options

You have several ways to integrate this into your project, depending on your goals:

As a Data Source (Recommended):  Use the RemoteSDRHandler in your sdr_geolocation_lib to connect to existing KiwiSDR servers (like the one at sdr.hu), retrieve IQ data, and then use that data for your geolocation algorithms or for generating training data for an AI model.  This is the cleanest and most modular approach. You wouldn't directly embed the KiwiSDR HTML/JS in this case. You've already done this in your refactoring.

Embedded Web Interface (Less Recommended): You could embed this entire KiwiSDR client interface within a larger application (e.g., a PyQt application with a web view, or a web application using a framework like Flask or Django). This would give you a full-featured KiwiSDR client alongside your geolocation tools. However, this adds significant complexity and might not be necessary if your primary goal is data acquisition.

As a Separate, Linked Application (Possible): Keep the KiwiSDR client as a completely separate HTML/JS application (running in a browser) and have your Python code (using the sdr_geolocation_lib) communicate with it indirectly, perhaps via a shared data file or a simple local web server. This is the least integrated option.

Direct Parsing and Control (Most Complex): You could, in theory, analyze the kiwisdr.min.js code, reverse-engineer the WebSocket protocol it uses, and write your own Python code to directly control a KiwiSDR server at the lowest level.  This is extremely complex and not recommended unless you have very specific requirements that the existing client can't meet.

Recommendation: Data Source Approach (Option 1)

Since your primary goal is to create a dataset for training a vision model, and you've already refactored your code to use the RemoteSDRHandler and KiwiSDRClient, the best approach is to enhance those classes to capture the necessary data.  Here's how:

Review RemoteSDRHandler and KiwiSDRClient: You already have these classes. Make sure they can:

Connect to a KiwiSDR server (you've already done this).
Request IQ data (not just audio and waterfall data) at a specified frequency and bandwidth. This is crucial.
The current implementation gets signal_strength, which is good, but you'll need the raw IQ data for more advanced signal processing and for your AI model.
Add Data Saving Functionality: Modify the KiwiSDRClient (or RemoteSDRHandler) to:

Receive the IQ data.
Optionally, perform some basic preprocessing (e.g., downsampling, filtering).
Save the IQ data to a file (e.g., in .npy format – a NumPy array – or .wav, or a custom binary format).
Create a corresponding metadata file (e.g., a .csv or .json file) that stores information about the captured data:
Timestamp
Center frequency
Sample rate
Receiver location (latitude, longitude, altitude)
Any other relevant parameters (e.g., antenna type)
(Later) The OCR text from the screen captures
Integrate with pycap.py: Have pycap.py run alongside your SDR data collection.  It will:

Capture screenshots.
Perform OCR.
Save the screenshots and OCR text, ideally with timestamps that match the timestamps in the SDR data files.
Dataset Structure:  Organize your dataset directory logically.  For example:

dataset/
├── 20240320_140000/  <-- Timestamped directory for a capture session
│   ├── iq_data_0000.npy
│   ├── iq_data_0001.npy
│   ├── ...
│   ├── metadata_0000.json
│   ├── metadata_0001.json
│   ├── ...
│   ├── frame_0000.png
│   ├── frame_0001.png
│   ├── ...
│   └── dataset.csv       <-- This could be combined with the metadata
└── 20240320_153000/  <-- Another capture session
    ├── ...

Key Changes and Next Steps:

get_iq_data: This is the most important addition. It's a placeholder; you'll need to examine the kiwisdr.min.js file (and potentially use your browser's developer tools to inspect network traffic when using a KiwiSDR) to determine the correct WebSocket messages or HTTP requests to send to get raw IQ data. The example above shows a potential HTTP GET request, but the actual KiwiSDR API might be different. You might need to use WebSockets.
capture_and_save_data: This function shows how to call get_iq_data and save the result to a NumPy .npy file. It also includes the creation of a basic metadata JSON.
Data Format: I've used .npy (NumPy's binary format) as a simple and efficient way to store the complex IQ data. You could use other formats if needed.
Error Handling: Add better error handling and reporting.
Integration into sdr_geolocation_lib: Integrate this into the RemoteSDRHandler, so that your SDRGeolocation class can easily access data from multiple KiwiSDRs.
By focusing on data acquisition through the RemoteSDRHandler, you keep your library well-structured.  The AI model training would then be a separate step, using the data you've collected. This approach avoids tightly coupling the data acquisition with the AI model, making your project more flexible and easier to maintain.
